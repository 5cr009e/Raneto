$C^k$ Continuous 

>  $U \sub \R^d$ be open, $f:U\to \R$, f is differentiable of class $C^k$ on U, k a non-negative integer,$\frac{\partial^\alpha f}{\partial r ^\alpha}$ exists and continuous on U for $[\alpha]\le k$ . In particular, f is $C^0$ if f is continuous.



Locally Euclidean space

> M of definition d is a Hausdorff topological space M for which each point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open subset of Euclidean space $\R^d$. If $\phi$ is a homeomorphism of a connected open set $U \sub M$ onto an open subset of $\R^d$ ,$\phi$ is called a coordinate map, the functions $x_i=r_i\circ \phi$ are called the coordinate functions, pair $(U,\phi)$is called a coordinate system.
